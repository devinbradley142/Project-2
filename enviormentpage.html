    <h1>What will happen to our enviorment?</h1>
    <h2>-Every living thing plays a role in the food chain and Earth's ecosystems, and the extinction of 
	certain species, whether predators or prey, can leave behind significant impacts
</h2>
    <h2>-if animals disappear including humans then the earth will become a barren land and the carbon 
	dioxide in the world will decrease and break the layer of atmosphere. this will lead to the burning 
	of earth and the gravity of the earth will decrease. the earth can also break apart.
</h2>
<h2>-Without plants and animals, our lives would not be possible. Oxygen, clean water and soil, 
and our earliest tools, food, and clothing came from flora and fauna.</h2>
