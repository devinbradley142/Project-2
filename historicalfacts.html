	Every year we have lost 1,000 to 10,000 animals to extinction. 30 to 50 percents go extinct by the year
	of 2050. Choral in oceans are going extinct by 2050 if they keep the terrible rate they are at which will affect oceans tramatically also effecting living animals.
	which is affecting living humans. In the yeaar of 2018 five common animals went extinct. 
	Extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to 
	five species per year. Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the 
	“background” rate, with dozens going extinct every day.  </h2>
