    <h1>Scientific Data</h1>
    <h2>Nearly 500 species have went extinct in the last year. More than 500 have disappeared due to our 
	degradation and destruction of their natrual habitats. In the year of 2019 we've had ten animals go extinct including:
	Dodo, Great Auk, Stellers Sea Cow, Tasmanian tiger, Passenger Pigeon, Pyrenean lbex,
	Baiji white Dolphin, and West African Black Rhinoceros. These are only the animals known to be extinct there could be many more.
	Less animals less oxygen!  Our planet is now in the midst of its sixth mass extinction of plants and 
	animals the sixth wave of extinctions in the past half-billion years. We're currently experiencing 
	the worst spate of species die-offs since the loss of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. 
	Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to 
	five species per year. Scientists estimate we're now losing species at up to 1,000 times the background 
	rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day. It could be a scary future indeed, with as 
	many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century.</h2>
