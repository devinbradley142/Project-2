    <h1>CAMPAIGN</h1>
    <h2>Illegal wildlife trade has exploded to meet increasing demand for elephant ivory, rhino horns, 
	and tiger products, particularly in Asia.</h2>
    <h2>Wildlife criminals often operate with freedom making the trade a low-risk/high-profit business. 
	Today it is the fifth most profitable illicit trade in the world, estimated at up to $10 billion 
	annually. Many species are protected by national and international laws because their populations 
	are at risk. When people kill or take them from the wild, despite this protection, the animal  or 
	plant and its products are all part of the illegal trade. Illegal trade in wild animals and plants is 
	not limited to endangered or threatened species. The sale of timber, firewood and charcoal stemming 
	from illegal logging or trade in fish that are caught in restricted areas or using illegal methods are, 
	for example, also included within the term illegal trade in wildlife.</h2>
