    <h1>Social justice</h1>
    <h2>-In order to make sure animal justice is being known emory wheel is creating campaigns and getting 
	signatures all over the world to prevent animals from be killed or used from necessary clothing
</h2>
    <h2>Ways that everyone can decease the amount of animals being killed is 
not letting business that are promoting animal fur lower you into purchasing there clothing,
When seeing lost animals report to animal control or even take them to a shelter yourself. 
Take some type of action animals have no voice so we need to be the voice that they do not have.
</h2>
<h2>Animal justice is tricky because they say you are not allowed to abuse animals but new animals are 
kilt everyday in factories for different types of foods that even alot of people do not eat so there is 
uncessary killing accuring. Please stand tall for animals that have no say so. 
If animals are legitimate subjects of justice, and animals suffer systemic and institutional domination 
and oppression, then animal rights is a social justice issue.</h2>
